# Codex Native Modes Reference

After `await_canvasight_run`, read `structuredContent.codexMode` first. If it is missing, treat `structuredContent.planMode === true` as `codexMode: "plan"`; otherwise default to `codexMode: "chat"`.

## Chat

For `chat`, continue as a normal Codex task using the returned Markdown as context.

## Plan

For `plan`, treat the Canvasight run as an explicit request to use Codex's native Plan mode.

`structuredContent.codexNative.status` must be `applied` before editing files, running side-effectful commands, or carrying out the work. If it is missing, failed, disabled, or skipped, stop and report that native Plan mode was not opened instead of silently downgrading to prose-only planning.

## Goal

For `goal`, treat the Canvasight run as an explicit request to use Codex's native Goal mode.

`structuredContent.codexNative.status` must be `applied` before editing files, running side-effectful commands, or carrying out the work. If it is missing, failed, disabled, or skipped, stop and report that native Goal mode was not opened instead of silently downgrading to a normal task.

## Prohibited Paths

Canvasight mode selection is a structured MCP contract backed by Codex app-server native requests. It must not reintroduce UI automation, Accessibility scripting, DOM clicks, clipboard paste, or `codex://threads/new` to toggle Codex controls.
